    \section{Result Achieved}

    Through the project I was able to develop a deeper understanding of autonomous robotic systems and the theory behind them.
    Working with the hardware was a new opportunity to learn how to interface with sensors and configure a different microcontroller to them.
    It also gave me the opportunity to learn programming languages I had little experience with previously. However, the most interesting
    part of the project was developing an entire system from scratch because this was not done before in other courses, figuring out the components,
    body, programming, software etc. By the end of the project I had been successful in my attempts to get real time data and configure sensors
    as well as helping my partner in developing the system code for the Robot and assembly.

    \section{Contribution}

    While the items listed below are things I dedicated most of my time to, it is important to note that my partner Youssef and
    me would work at the same time so there was constant input by both of us on the tasks that each person was doing. Therefore, although
    I had 'worked' on these parts it in no way discredits the efforts of my partner in development:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identifying components to order for Robot
        \item Soldering work and Robot assembly
        \item Developing all code to interface with the Encoders and Accelerometer
        \item Developing code for connection of microcontroller to server
        \item Developing code for frontend/backend (All Visualization)
        \item Setting up Github Repository for Project
    \end{itemize}

    By examining our Github Repository and it's commits it also shows our contributions to the code of the project
    over time (https://github.com/NasirKhalid24/ELE494-08-Project). In terms of novelty, from our research we were unable
    to find a system like ours where data was transmitted in real time the same way we had done it through a front and back end.
